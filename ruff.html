               <h2> Ruff n Ready </h2>
            </div>
            <p> A dog walker app where users are able to find walkers for their dogs
               while away from home. Throughout this process, I learned to create
               an app for both android and iOS mobile environments. Conducting
               user research had helped me develop the app correctly in both
               environments.

  <h2>Takeaways</h2>
  <p>Overall this project had challenged me to create native apps for both ios and androids.
Being a apple user, it was interesting on learning android ui elements and incorporating it
to my designs.
Things I would change for my next project is to create a better understanding on testing
for my users. By building scripts and a better description on what is being tested.</p>
